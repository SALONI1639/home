<h3><p>The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic where the main story revolves around two branches of a family - the Pandavas and Kauravas - who, in the Kurukshetra War, battle for the throne of Hastinapura.<br>
 Interwoven into this narrative are several smaller stories about people dead or living, and philosophical discourses. <br>
 Krishna-Dwaipayan Vyasa, himself a character in the epic, composed it; as, according to tradition, he dictated the verses and Ganesha wrote them down.<br>
 At 100,000 verses, it is the longest epic poem ever written, generally thought to have been composed in the 4th century BCE or earlier.<br>
 The events in the epic play out in the Indian subcontinent and surrounding areas. It was first narrated by a student of Vyasa at a snake-sacrifice of the great-grandson of one of the major characters of the story.
 Including within it the Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata is one of the most important texts of ancient Indian, indeed world, literature.</p></h3>

Dhritarashtra, Pandu & Vidur.
So that the family line did not die out, Satyavati summoned her son Vyasa to impregnate the two queens. Vyasa had been born to Satyavati of a great sage named Parashar before her marriage to Shantanu.<br> According to the laws of the day, a child born to an unwed mother was taken to be a step-child of the mother's husband; by that token, Vyasa could be considered Shantanu's son and could be used to perpetuate the Kuru clan that ruled Hastinapur.<br> Thus, by the Niyog custom, the two queens each had a son of Vyasa: to the elder queen was born a blind son called Dhritarashtra, and to the younger was born an otherwise healthy but extremely pale son called Pandu.<br>
 To a maid of these queens was born a son of Vyasa called Vidur.<br> Bheeshm brought up these three boys with great care.<br> Dhritarashtra grew up to be the strongest of all princes in the country, Pandu was extremely skilled in warfare and archery, and Vidur knew all the branches of learning, politics, and statesmanship.

With the boys grown, it was now time to fill up the empty throne of Hastinapur.<br> Dhritarashtra, the eldest, was bypassed because the laws barred a disabled person from being king.<br> Pandu, instead, was crowned.<br>
 Bheeshm negotiated Dhritarashtra's marriage with Gandhari, and Pandu's with Kunti and Madri.<br> Pandu expanded the kingdom by conquering the sorrounding areas, and brought in considerable war booty.<br> With things running smoothly in the country, and with its coffers full, Pandu asked his elder brother to look after the state affairs, and retired to the forests with his two wives for some time off.</p></h3>

A few years later, Kunti returned to Hastinapur.<br> With her were five little boys, and the bodies of Pandu and Madri.<br> The five boys were the sons of Pandu, born to his two wives through the Niyog custom from gods: the eldest was born of Dharma, the second of Vayu, the third of Indra, and the youngest - twins - of the Ashvins.<br> In the meanwhile, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari too had had children of their own: 100 sons and one daughter.<br> The Kuru elders performed the last rites for Pandu and Madri, and Kunti and the children were welcomed into the palace.

All of the 105 princes were subsequently entrusted to the care of a teacher: Kripa at first and, additionally, Drona later.<br> Drona's school at Hastinapur attracted several other boys; Karna, of the Suta clan was one such boy.<br> It was here that hostilities quickly developed between the sons of Dhritarashtra (collectively called the Kauravas, patronymic of their ancestor Kuru) and the sons of Pandu (collectively called the Pandavas, patronymic of their father).

Duryodhana, the eldest Kaurava, tried - and failed - to poison Bheem, the second Pandava. Karna, because of his rivalry in archery with the third Pandava, Arjuna, allied himself with Duryodhan. In time, the princes learnt all they could from their teachers, and the Kuru elders decided to hold a public skills exhibition of the princes.<br> It was during this exhibition that the citizens became plainly aware of the hostilities between the two branches of the royal family:<br> Duryodhan and Bheem had a mace fight that had to be stopped before things turned ugly, Karna - uninvited as he was not a Kuru prince - challenged Arjuna, was insulted on account of his non-royal birth, and was crowned king of a vassal state on the spot by Duryodhan. It was also around this time that questions began to be raised about Dhritarashtra occupying the throne, since he was supposed to be holding it only in trust for Pandu, the crowned king. To keep peace in the realm, Dhritarashtra declared the eldest Pandava, Yudhishthir, as the crown prince and heir apparent.
